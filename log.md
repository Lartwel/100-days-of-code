# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 15, Saturday, 2018].


### Day 1: 14/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and "Survey Form" project of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well. I've a few sections to complete that will take a few days to my first cert on freeCodeCamp

### Day 2: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections and also the most of "CSS Flexbox".

**Thoughts:** I only coded on FCC and I will continue on it tomorrow and study some of the React Course.

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and the "Landing Page" project at FCC.

### Day 4: 17/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the last 2 projects of the "Responsive Web Design" certification and got the cert

**Thoughts:** I've coded a lot, but a lot of wasted time too. Btw I'm jubilant that I've got my first cert at FCC and I'm planning to start the cert of the front-end libraries as I want to learn React well.
