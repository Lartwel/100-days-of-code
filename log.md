# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 15, Saturday, 2018].


### Day 1: 14/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and "Survey Form" project of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well. I've a few sections to complete that will take a few days to my first cert on freeCodeCamp

### Day 2: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections and also the most of "CSS Flexbox".

**Thoughts:** I only coded on FCC and I will continue on it tomorrow and study some of the React Course.

### Day 3: 16/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and the "Landing Page" project at FCC.

### Day 4: 17/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the last 2 projects of the "Responsive Web Design" certification and got the cert

**Thoughts:** I've coded a lot, but wasted a lot of time too. Btw I'm jubilant that I've got my first cert at FCC and I'm planning to start the cert of the front-end libraries as I want to learn React well.

### Days 5-6: 19/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "SASS" section at FCC and started in the "React" section and listened to my 1st episode at Syntax.fm

**Thoughts:** I've been busy due to some house works and it seems that the next few weeks will be busy because of the same reason, but I'll do my best to practice coding though. I've also listened to the Syntax podcast's episode called "How to slam dunk your freelancing" and I didn't get much benefit from it, but there's another episode called "Advice For Beginners" and I think it'll be much beneficial  to me.

### Days 7-10: 23/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "React" section at FCC

**Thoughts:** It was a long section there, but it was really helpful. I learned a lot about React. And I am going to start in the "Redux" section and google some React apps to build one as a practice
