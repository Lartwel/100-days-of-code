# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 15, Saturday, 2018].

* Note: I code more than 1 hour most of days in addition to learning/reading some stuff related to Web Development. The bad thing that I occasionally become very busy due to some works out of my control, but the day that I can't code in, I add its hours to another day or it'll be added to the end of the challenge

### Day 1: 14/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and "Survey Form" project of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well. I've a few sections to complete that will take a few days to my first cert on freeCodeCamp

### Day 2: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections and also the most of "CSS Flexbox".

**Thoughts:** I only coded on FCC and I will continue on it tomorrow and study some of the React Course.

### Day 3: 16/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and the "Landing Page" project at FCC.

### Day 4: 17/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the last 2 projects of the "Responsive Web Design" certification and got the cert

**Thoughts:** I've coded a lot, but wasted a lot of time too. Btw I'm jubilant that I've got my first cert at FCC and I'm planning to start the cert of the front-end libraries as I want to learn React well.

### Days 5-6: 19/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "SASS" section at FCC and started in the "React" section and listened to my 1st episode at Syntax.fm

**Thoughts:** I've been busy due to some house works and it seems that the next few weeks will be busy because of the same reason, but I'll do my best to practice coding though. I've also listened to the Syntax podcast's episode called "How to slam dunk your freelancing" and I didn't get much benefit from it, but there's another episode called "Advice For Beginners" and I think it'll be much beneficial  to me.

### Days 7-10: 23/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "React" section at FCC and read 2 articles at JavaScript.info

**Thoughts:** It was a long section there, but it was really helpful. I learned a lot about React. And I am going to start in the "Redux" section and google some React apps to build one as a practice. I also read 2 articles "Debugging in Chrome" & "Ninja code" at javascript.info and they were informative. The website has great tutorials for JavaScript

### Day 11: 24/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied throw the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) tutorials and built the first project "JS Drums" and read for some time at Medium

**Thoughts:** The 1st project of JS30 was beneficial and easy and I've made a GitHub repo for the projects I am building that are bases on the tutorials.

### Day 12: 25/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied throw the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) tutorials and built the second project "Clock" and learned some ways of creating/changing arrays through an article on Medium

**Thoughts:** I've created 2 versions of the clock (one is analog and the second is digital) and the article was helpful in some points, but I think I need to learn more about Array.from and other methods.

### Day 13: 26/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  I learned some tutorials through the React Course and studied through the DOM course of Elzero and watched a talk on youtube for Wes Bos and it was about his journey of learning JS and related technologies

**Thoughts:** I think I should read more in docs/books like Wes had done. They're not fun as tutorials, but they have the details that I'm looking for in some situations. They have better knowledge than video tutorials.

### Days 14-16 : 27-29/07/2018

**Today's Progress: just surfed some articles and websites for web development

**Thoughts:** I didn't code due to being too busy, but I'll add 3 days to the end of the challenge



### Day 16: 30/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Finished some tasks of the Redux Section at FCC and read some articles

**Thoughts:** I think that I need to postpone going through the 'Front-end Libraries' cert at FCC. I find the Redux section confusing and I think that I need to improve my React's skills more and more to understand how Redux made a difference and to build the projects in a better quality.



### Day 17: 31/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Learned some DOM tutorials at Elzero Course and learned new stuff about ES6 through a cheatsheet

**Thoughts:** I also watched a video tutorial that has recommended good resources for learning how to contribute to GitHub open source projects (that's helpful for getting a job too)

### Days 18-20: 3/08/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied DOM Course, practiced it, Completed the 'Basic JavaScript' section, and finished the 'ES6' section at FCC Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures

**Thoughts:** As I've mentioned before, I left the 'Front-end Libraries' Certification for some time till I learn Redux well. I had finished most of the Basic JavaScript section before completing it nowadays, but some of its took some time to solve.

### Days 21: 4/08/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied DOM Course, practiced it, and pracitced the 3rd project of JS30 & deployed the it.

**Thoughts:** I think that my progress of the DOM course is slow. Although it's easy and helpful so I'll do my best to move forward.

### Days 22: 5/08/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied DOM Course and practiced it. I also read an article about a developer journey who had a full-time job and studied for 9 months and got a job.

**Thoughts:** The artcile inspired me and it's an awesome motivation for learning more and more. That developer had the 100DaysOfCode challenge too.
