# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 15, Saturday, 2018].


### Day 1: 14/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and "Survey Form" project of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well. I've a few sections to complete that will take a few days to my first cert on freeCodeCamp

### Day 2: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished "Applied Accessibility" and "Responsive Web Design Principles" sections and also the most of "CSS Flexbox".

### Day 3: 16/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the "CSS Flexbox" and "CSS Grid" sections and the "Landing Page" project at FCC.

### Day 4: 17/07/2018 (at mid-night) 

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the last 2 projects of the "Responsive Web Design" certification and got the cert

**Thoughts:** I've coded a lot, but wasted a lot of time too. Btw I'm jubilant that I've got my first cert at FCC and I'm planning to start the cert of the front-end libraries as I want to learn React well.

### Days 5-6: 19/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "SASS" section at FCC and started in the "React" section and listened to my 1st episode at Syntax.fm

**Thoughts:** I've been busy due to some house works and it seems that the next few weeks will be busy because of the same reason, but I'll do my best to practice coding though. I've also listened to the Syntax podcast's episode called "How to slam dunk your freelancing" and I didn't get much benefit from it, but there's another episode called "Advice For Beginners" and I think it'll be much beneficial  to me.

### Days 7-10: 23/07/2018

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the "React" section at FCC and read 2 articles at JavaScript.info

**Thoughts:** It was a long section there, but it was really helpful. I learned a lot about React. And I am going to start in the "Redux" section and google some React apps to build one as a practice. I also read 2 articles "Debugging in Chrome" & "Ninja code" at javascript.info and they were informative. The website has great tutorials for JavaScript

### Day 11: 24/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied throw the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) tutorials and built the first project "JS Drums" and read for some time at Medium

**Thoughts:** The 1st project of JS30 was beneficial and easy and I've made a GitHub repo for the projects I am building that are bases on the tutorials.

### Day 12: 25/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Studied throw the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) tutorials and built the second project "Clock" and learned some ways of creating/changing arrays through an article on Medium

**Thoughts:** I've created 2 versions of the clock (one is analog and the second is digital) and the article was helpful in some points, but I think I need to learn more about Array.from and other methods.

### Day 13: 26/07/2018 

**Today's Progress**:  I learned some tutorials through the React Course and studied through the DOM course of Elzero and watched a talk on youtube for Wes Bos and it was about his journey of learning JS and related technologies

**Thoughts:** I think I should read more in docs/books like Wes had done. They're not fun as tutorials, but they have the details that I'm looking for in some situations. They have better knowledge than video tutorials.
