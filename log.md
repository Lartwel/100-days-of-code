# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1

## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 15, Saturday, 2018].


### Day 1: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and Finished "Survey Form" project of of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well. I've a few sections to complete that will take a few days to my first cert on freeCodeCamp
