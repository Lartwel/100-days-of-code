### Day 1: 15/07/2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Applied Visual Design" section and Finished "Survey Form" project of of freeCodeCamp' "Responsive Web Design Certificate(300 hours)"

**Thoughts:** Most of the section content was not new to me, but the survey form had some inputs' atrributes that I couldn't remember well.
